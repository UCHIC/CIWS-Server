## Cyberinfrastructure for Intelligent Water Supply (CIWS) 

CIWS is a project funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation to develop cyberinfrastructure for smart water metering and high resolution water-use data collection. We are developing systems for residential water consumption data collection, processing and analysis. This repository contains source code for back-end database, data loaders, and web service functionality for smart metering data management. Some of this work is being prototyped using an implementation in Utah State University's student residential buildings. These buildings are fitted with a water meter that has an external 4-20mA output whose voltage varies depending on instantaneous water use.
