# CIWS-Server 

This repository contains source code for back-end database, data loaders, and web service functionality for smart water metering data management. We prototyped this work using open-source hardware dataloggers used for collecting data from individual residential homes and multi-unit residential buildings.

## Cyberinfrastructure for Intelligent Water Supply (CIWS) 

CIWS is a project funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation to develop cyberinfrastructure for smart water metering and high resolution water-use data collection. We are developing systems for high resolution residential water consumption data collection, processing and analysis.

## Deploying CIWS

[Deployment instructions](https://github.com/UCHIC/CIWS-Server/blob/master/doc/deployment_guide.md) for CIWS can be found in the "doc" folder of this repository.
